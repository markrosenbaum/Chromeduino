## About

The chrome app uses the serial API on the chrome browser to program AVR arduinos with a serial bootloader that is avrdude compatible (Arduino Uno, Mega, etc).
It is a (limited) Arduino IDE and uses a server to compile (since I (spaceneedle) was not crazy enough to write a javascript port of a GCC cross compiler for 8bit AVR)

## Buy Us a Coffee

The point of this project, currently, is to provide a free option for people to program an arduino with a chromebook. (like in an educational setting), Thus we will not charge for it.

Saying that, this project is large and takes a lot of coffee to develop, not to mention the cost of hosting the compiling servers, if you'd like to buy us a coffee or two, you can use the button bellow to donate to the developers:

## Run Your Own Compile Server

### Linux

Make sure you have the latest node.js installed.

 1. `git clone https://github.com/spaceneedle/Chromeduino.git`
 2. `cd "Chromeduino/Chromeduino Server"`
 3. `npm install`
 4. check install with `ls`, if there is *no* folder called `arduino-1.8.5` then run `curl https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-1.8.5-linux64.tar.xz | tar -xJ`
 5. `node app`
 6. go to `http://localhost:3000/version`
 
You can change the port in the config.json.
 
### Windows
Wipe and install linux.
 
### Share the Love <3
 
If you have a dev VPS or something lying around, why not help the community and run a public compile server on it. (You can also add some shameless self promotion in the description)
 
 1. Make sure you have pm2 installed `npm i pm2 -g`
 2. Launch the server with pm2 `pm2 start app.js -n chromeduino`
 3. Make it run on startup `pm2 save` and `pm2 startup` read the output of those commands.
 4. Edit the server.json file with your compile server's details and then submit a pull request. If you are unsure how to do that, post an issue with the details and we'll do it for you.
